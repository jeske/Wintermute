HOW TO CREATE INSTALLER:

1) In Netbeans, right click on xmltool.jar and click "compile"
2) In Netbeans, right click on wm.jar and click "compile"
3) In command prompt from "output" directory, type "run" and
   make sure the software runs correctly

   This also copies your new wm.jar to the "jars" directory
   where it is pulled into the installer from!

4) In windows explorer, right click on "wm.nsi" and choose 
   "Compile NSI" (depend\nsis*.exe must be installed)
