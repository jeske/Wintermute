------ QUESTIONS ----------------------------------------------

Q: Should column size and ordering be shared by all users of that columnset?
   A: probably. Which means we should actually reorder the relation and set
      the "size" properties of the columns.  (this will fix sort order arrows)
Q: How do we make a "clonable" subtree of GUI related items. For example,
   a "contacts GUI" should be a window, with subviews, and possible popup
   frames or dialogs. When we want to create a new instance, we need to know
   what to copy. (somewhat like "ownership" and "original authoring"??) 
Q: How to do "Lotus Agenda" style "Direct Relation Entry". For example,
   if we show a "Project" column in a table, I should be able to go there
   and just type in the name of a project (with completion) to build the
   relation. If I type a project name which does not exist, it would either
   automatically create it, or ask me if I wanted to create it) When I do
   this, am I editing a text-property of the item? or am I just using a
   field editor which understands projects? 
   A: I _think_ this should be a relation-aware field editor. It should
      have pull-down capabilities for selecting from a list as well as 
      text-completion. Maybe the column header should automatically show 
      a <-> link icon if it's display data from a relation. Like Agenda,
      the target's parent should define settings such as "auto-create"
      and "indexed/unindexed". unindexed fields should not get pull-down
      or unique support.

   
------ CRITICAL BUGS ------------------------------------------

- column reorder puts sort arrow in wrong place
- dragging a column should not cause a sort to start
- itemguitable should only restore selection state when asked to

------ IN PROGRESS (jeske) ------------------------------------

- column appearance tab
  - heading title
  - sizing behavior
  - alignment
  - heading icon
  

------ Alpha-1 (3/10!) --------------------------------------------

features:
- change object serialization to XML (w/version)
- safeguard originally authored data

- (done) "From" contact display/edit minitool
- "create" contact mini-tool
- contact recent messages (subj) minitool
- related addrs w/hoverover contact minitool

- customize column header icon/size

- hookup toolbar buttons (compose, Sync, reply)
- sync should also pull down message contents (so it is indexed)

- basic Contacts GUI to show related email

- better sync status feedback

bugs:
- imap sync breaks in the middle without completing
- fieldname hover popups get left around

- out of memory error w/text index & rb turned on
- deadlock/lockup

- rbManager does not run on first app start
- re-adding the same imap server does not work (i.e. it finds
  existing folders and does not create new ones, should use
  item.getItem())
- folder should remember the colset selected on that folder
- solition for the "AbsoluteLayout" problem (i.e. it's a netbeans class)
- resoring saved item selection does not work right
- clicking on item in calendar list should goto that day
- initial searchbox size
- new account should be a non-modal dialog
- calendar GUI should show #Date in colconfig, not "Date"

- RDF import did not update JTable immediately (due to initially
  empty colconfig?)


check:
- (fixed?) imap message parent bugs 
- (fixed?) keyboard nav in folder throws cast exceptions during imap sync


------ Alpha-2 ------------------------------------------------

features:
- make itemInspector use ItemGUIDocument (itemguidocument
  will need to clone new content view)

- "startup wizard" to:
  - pick repository location (save as pref)
  - start new account wizard
- all items should have "Summary"
- support attachment display/open in ItemGUIEmailMessage
- new "separate" debug tool (i.e. log to a file using 
  java logging API, and then write a separate application which
  watches and displays logfiles WITHOUT having to keep all logs in
  memory all the time.)
- highlight backgroud of sorted table column (i.e. like WinXP)
- add html "welcome" page
- search tool should auto-select results and have "clear" button
- method to rebuild GUI
- build thread relations
- user defined 'categories' (w/pattern) (status,project,topic)
- record changes and push back to imap
  - leave deleted items in the view until "purge"/"update"
- background sorting
- better contact GUI
- hover over contacts list brings up contact mini-view
- tear off mini views
  
bugs:
- creating a new columnset should:
  - prompt for columnset name
  - copy the current column set
  - select the new column set
  - open the customize dialog
- clicking on folder in tree is sluggish
- column iconset editor
- #Date columns should default to "Date" formatter
- stop relation builders from running on "all" objects/changes
- deleting an item in tree should unselect it from ItemGUIDocument
  (should either select root node, or previously selected node)

------ Alpha-3 -----------------------------------------------

features:
- treetable w/threads
- window status bar
  - number of background threads
  - information about current "document"
- better "offline" support
- table row appearance
  - default (font,color,background color)
  - multiple configurations triggered by data
    - bold when unread
    - background colors by Contact record group
- derived data fields registry
  - compatibility by: datatype or specific fieldids
  - Ex: From Name/Email, AddressedTo, FromContact?
  - Special "FlagSelection" which stores it's own data used
    for checkboxes and message flagging
- ItemGUISelector for lower-left corner pane selection 
  - consider building into MultiView as configuration option

    
------ Places to put things (before modules)  -----------------

ItemGUIDocument viewer selector:
  - right click to get a list of GUI viewers
  - remember the viewer used for a given type
Client to client sync:
  - "ItemP2PSync"
    - every instance will have a generated GUID server ID
      (just pick a random number for now) 
    - uses "P2PSyncChannel" (email,http,raw) to establish
      an initial connection
    - contains a set of "ItemP2PSyncSpec" which point 
      to objects which should be shared. A pointer can either
      be an "individual oid" or an "oid:relation" for all objects
      in a relation. The syncspec will also contain read/write
      policy information. Initially just read-only or read-write,
      eventually it might have "field visibilty" or "lease status"
      for getting a "write lease" on an object.
    - contains a list of objects which have changed since the
      last sync which is updated by "ItemRBP2PSync"
    - "ItemRBP2PSync" relation builder which is registered with 
      relation builder and (a) checks to see if the changed 
      object is listed in an ItemP2PSyncSpec
      (b) if it is, adds it to the list of objects which need
      to be synchronized out to that client when the
      sync occurs. (eventually it should have smaller granularity
      but for now whole objects is fine)
    - "ItemP2PSync" should have a "sync" action which bottles up
      the list of changed objects and ships it off to the remote
      instance. When objects are received, they should be created
      with an "owner" reference to the P2PSync channel, and a
      "ownerInstance" field pointing to the instance GUID, and 
      an "ownerOID" field recording the owner OID. The object
      "name" should be the combination of those two for now.
    - ItemGUITable's configure pulldown menu should have a 
      "share items..." entry which brings up a sharing dialog to
      configure who to share the items with.
      
    - (Maybe) Every item should have a "share" action 
      (pulldown menu action). This would bring up a sharing 
      dialog which will let you choose (a)the item or a 
      particular relation of the item, (b) a P2PSync 
      instance, (c) permissions -- and it should then 
      create the ItemP2PSyncSpec record as appropriate. [[The
      danger of this is that you are not seeing the items
      you are about to share. One way to fix this might be to
      make is so that you can only share the items viewed by
      the "viewed_item_relation" which will be displayed
      when you click on the item, although I don't know how
      we would do that. - jeske ]]
    
  
Display Filters/Incorporation Filters
  - remove messages below a certain score
  - remove messages from a certain author
  - search for something in relation contents
  - http://www.mozilla.org/projects/grendel/filters.html

------ TASKS (before modules) --------------------------------

Email Compose:
- support plain or html composition
- support attachments (DnD or chooser)
- save as draft
- send by creating ItemEmailMessage object and putting in
  "outbound" relation somewhere
- email address completion (based on contact records)
- edit all headers dialog
- compose window menu 
   File->Save,Send
   Edit->Copy, Paste
   View->Options, Header Fields
   Insert->File,Item,Signature,Picture,Hyperlink
   Format->Plain,HTML,Style,Font,Paragraph,Encoding,
       Background
   Tools->Spelling, Address Book, Customize
- primary toolbar items (send, save draft, attach) 
- secondary toolbar items (importance high, flag for 
  followup, options - see outlook, address book,
  check names)
- formatting toolbar items (Plain/Html,Font,F-Size,etc.)

Toolbar/Menubar/Actions:
- toolbar sections which disappear when out of
  context (i.e. reply/forward toolbar disappear when
  email folder viewer not visible)
- different toolbars/menubars for different windows!
- toolbar buttons which disable when out of context
  (i.e. reply disable when no message selected or
        key focus lost - see Outlook)
- "button arrow menu" for "New" button
- toolbar button configuration
- (done: 2/14) add toolbar/menubar

Toolbar Idea 2:
- each GUI component can register one toolbar, with a configurable set of buttons
- ItemGUIDocument registers a configurable toolbar, and switches out the contents
  based on the currently displayed document. (How to make overflow items work? 
  Proxy Toolbar?)

Toolbar Ideas 1:
- cascade toolbar population down through GUI
- show all toolbars during "unlocked" mode
- ItemGUI isVisible -> false should hide toolbars
  and ItemGUI isVisible -> true should show toolbars
- ItemGUIDocument should have outlook folder bar
  - this folder bar should have "gui chooser",
    "action chooser", etc..
- ItemGUI should have a "save context" which it
  finds by walking up the tree. ItemGUIFrame will
  provide the default save context. ItemGUIDocument
  will provide a save context which uses both the
  viewed item and the "url". 
  - items which are saved should be named well.
  - a configuration UI would allow the user to
    determine how and where something is saved.
    For example, "Scrollbar position" would be
    saved to the folder every time it was changed.
    However, the splitter position would only be
    saved when the user clicked a "save views"
    button.


- look at:
   http://www2.creo.com/sixdegrees/

Column Config: 
- set column alignment/size
- set column header title/icon
- let user build new regex based formatters
- set editable state for fields
- add "define column" which is basically "define field"
- build enum based field entry for editable fields
- derived columns registered by item type
  - email "summary" should combine subject,size,etc.
  - derived column so it can be changed later!
- (done: 2/11) configure date formatter for column
- (done: 2/12) set formatter for column

Small Items:
- build a way to destroy and recreate only the GUI
- email status column header should have image title

Organize Sync Process:
- single "send/receive" button to trigger sync
- progress bar for each sync conduit.
- toolbar sync "advanced" arrow for selecting
  what to sync specifically.

Background Thread Manager:
- Show moving status icons when "foreground"
  threads are running, such as fetching or rendering
  an email message, IMAP sync, etc.
- separate display for "background" threads such as
  relationship building, text indexing, and other non-user
  initiated tasks.
- display progress for threads (i.e. "40/2342", or progress bar)
- windows idle monitor: so we can run "background" threads 
  only when machine is idle... possible just mouse movement

Database:
- (done) fields should be in the tree
- objects should point to a "type object" (instantiation type,
  plus data subtype)
- type objects should point to fields they define
- fields should always be defined in terms of a type
  object (i.e. schema)



Categories:
- file messages in categories (possibly multiple categories)
- filter view to only messages in a category (drag and drop
  on filter bar)
- add category (list) to columns
- automatically categorize based on text-matching relation
  builder.

Keyboard Accelerators:
- accerators should be in or out of context 
  similar to toolbars

------ TASK: MODULES -----------------------------------------

Extensibility/Modules:
- a module should encapsulate and contain:
  - the datatype schema (Item types and their valid fields)
  - the code functionality for the module
  - GUI views/icons available to render these and other objects
  - Actions available on the module, Items, or GUI panes for
    use in (a) adding to toolbars, (b) making keybindings, etc.
  - Default setups and keybindings which can be easily added
    to a user's existing installation at initial module load,
    and easily removed later.
- assertions and data-validity checks for app/module interfaces
- sandboxing

------ TASKS (independent of modules) -------------------------

Calendar:
- create/setup "ItemGUICalendarDay" and put in a MultiView panel
- create "overlay selection pane". This should let one choose
  from a set of different overlays of items. For example,
  "Movies" and "Personal" and "Email" would be different
  overlay items. Right clicking on an item in the overlay list
  should include a Property panel which would allow you to
  set settings such as the color and font of those overlay
  items.
- dates in matchers need to find CLOSEST date, biased
  towards the future, NOT the date in the current year.
  I.e. "Jan 2" matched on Dec 10th 2002 should be
  Jan 2 2003, NOT 2002.

MultiView GUI Component:
- multiview mode for displaying several 
  derived items (i.e. from email message, follow
  email:addr->addr:contact and then display
  each contact record in a multiview collapsepane,
  with a title related to how the contact was
  made)
  

Sorting Improvements:
- sorting should happen in the background
- while sorting, make a progress "bounce bar" 
  in the header.
- flash header bad on initial click for feedback
- flash header bar on completion, 1/4 second before
  we switch the display to the new sorted version
  to give the user warning
- maybe add a hoverover popup w/progress bar

Search:
- search toolbar should have (a) text field, 
  (b) search current button, (c) search all
  button, (d) clear search button.
- searching should switch the view
- "generic" search results UI using "Summary"
- enter/alt-enter should map to search buttons
- ESC should map to clear search when in search
  results pane, and go back to where you came from

DB speedup/fixes:
- write custom serialization/unserialization
  for simpleitemstorage so it is not subject to
  class changes.
- (done) convert sleepycat db access to transactions
- print the elapsed time of a checkpoint to debug window
- need to add a computed "summary" field to all item types
- weak reference the item data so it can be independently
  freed.
- pre-stored sort orders/filters

UI Responsiveness:
- initial window open delay comes from loading disk
  based objects during window show. Build a prefetch
  stage. (i.e. have it render to a buffer or something)
- make message MIMEdecode & Render happen in the
  background.
- compose "matching" should be in background thread


------ BUGS ---------------------------------------


- windows default font is really bad, set to Arial 11pt
- mv does not show on initial gui build
  - multiview/splitpane should watch itemchange events
    for their own item data. (i.e. when you add
    a new view to a multiview or splitpane, it should
    really add the view)
- item does not stay selected on table data update
  when sorted
- JTable has white vertical lines between columns, remove them
- column size save does not work
- shutdown is not totally clean
- column config dialog on new column config dosn't work right
- column config for default viewer should be specific to item 
  (or item "subtype") not GUI
- switching between folders should not require so many
  object saves
- fetching data from an IMAP connection that was open
  but has timed out throws exception (should checkConnected()
  and Connect() if necessary)

- (done) windows L&F has extra inset borders around things, remove 
- (done) fix tree model threading and notifications (delete is broken!)
- (done) menu does not show on initial gui build
- (done) small/fixed column sizes don't properly save/keep


----- SEPARABLE SUBPROJECTS -----------------------

- Outlook style sidebar
- VS.NET style property editor panel w/categories

Contacts UI Prototype:
  - simple "contact card" GUI w/edit in place
  - show all cards in scrolling list (see outlook)
  - need mechanism for linking email address/company
  - showing related items
  - use "contact card" in email ui
  - add "notes" field
- calendar GUI components
  - need: GUI mockups and API description
    - calendar model
    - calendar overlay selection/model
    - toolbar actions
    - mockup: month, week, day views
    - mockup: calendar "timeline" (outlook journal)
- advanced JTable
  - section expand (see outlook)
  - TreeTable
- XP L&F Manager
  - get rid of "double border" present in standard L&F
    around tables and trees in scrollers.
  - XP Scrollbars
  - XP Menu
    - proper menu background color
    - Dark invert rollover highlight
    - white menu w/icons
    - separator lines
    - alpha drop shadow (when lightweight panel)
  - XP JTable Feel 
    - column horizontal border tick (not full vertical height)
    - sorted column select
      - background gray column
      - orange strip on bottom of column header
    - XP style alpha column drag
    - right click on column to customize table
    - no top border on table
  - XP TreeTable
    - same as above
    - alpha drag-select box
    - icon to the left of text in Name field
    - click to select only selects name (like in tree) not row 
    
    
------ PROTOCOLS ------------------------------------------------

- TODO: NNTP, IM(AIM,YIM,ICQ,Jabber,Dave-IM), MS-FreeBusy, MAPI
- TODO APPS: Salesforce, Trakken, SiebelCRM, OracleCRM, 
       OracleCorporateTime, PalmDesktop/Palm, 
        
- Done: IMAP, POP, SMTP, iCal, RSS, YahooIntellisync

------ LATER ----------------------------------------------------

Notification Engine:
- incremental xpath scheme for registering notifications
- should store sort order on disk for large lists


New Email Header Expansion:
- min: display a subset of delivery headers
       to conserve space. Header is above 
       scrollable email display. Hoverover
       CC will show all entries.
       
- max: display ALL headers. Email Headers
       and email body should be in a single
       scrollpane.

todo:
- multidimensional outliner based on TreeTable
  - Dave Winer "MORE"
  - OMNIOutliner
  - OPML: http://www.opml.org/
- calendar event which creates a todo item
- todo items without due dates
- "postpone" button to put something off for a week and bring it back
- "eventually" for far off projects
- email followup ...
- expect email reply ...

Other Applications:
- workflow (bugtracking, resume/jobs, document review/publish)

Relate To?
- ItemPossibleRelation
- should show up in "multi-panel" on the right
  of an email message, and ask the question:
  "Should this be related to one of these entries?"
  For example, should the email record be related
  to one of the following contact records, or a 
  new one?

Calendar Ideas:
- useful post about iCal, CAP, and Calendar Standards:
  http://lists.osafoundation.org/pipermail/design/2003-January/001677.html
- figure out how to allow a user to add images of moon phases
  or tides from a weatherunderground module
- select text and "send to calendar", for example,
  in the email it would include a list of events like:

   Thurs Jan 30 - meet with the parents day
   Tues  Feb 2 - science fair

  The user would manually select the first line, and 
  right-click to "send to calendar". Alternatively,
  the context popup could come up because he selected 
  the text.
- Download "Corporate Time" client as a UI reference:
  http://software.wm.edu/win-emailcomm.html
- ?? Support Oracle CorporateTime server sync (formerly
  Netscape Calendar Server, and Google uses this).
   http://www.steltor.com/documentation/
- UI Ideas here:
    http://www.webevent.com/

Sync Sources:
- Bugzilla
- Trakken Issues
- Trakken KB

Random Ideas:
- sticky notes which you can add to any item and which display
  when that item is displayed. (how do they get shown/hidden
  in the UI? ItemGUI show/hide notification? Does this mean
  DefaultItem needs to have some kind of aggregation/category
  loading for extension of item capabilities?)
- store "all" data on an IMAP server in some hacky format
  (IMAP backing store)
- outlook/evolution summary page

Other Tools:
- multi-user "rating" system for rating anything from webpages
  to plugin modules
- bitzi.com plugin (bitstream content identification)

IMAP/Email:
- automatic conversion of attachments (Word, PDF, Excel) to text
  or html for (a) text-indexing, (b) simple inline display
- make it easy to add email response templates/signatures via macros
- easily setup "followup", or "expected reply" alarms when composing
  (ex. I send out asking for a dinner time confirmation, or for an
    update on a work project. If I don't receive a reply in X days
    then I need this item to flip up in my inbox as high priority.)
- support "bounce to" message w/ resent-to header
- support outgoing smtp login/auth
- support PGP/SMIME for signing and encryption
  - could create a secure email service which would:
    - verify addresses/keys (email round-trip?)
    - offer on the web SSL delivery for clients without
      smime support
- configurable automatic compression of uncompressed attachments
  in outgoing messages. (i.e. compress BMP, EXE, etc, using ZIP
  on windows)
- make method to control email content display settings (i.e.
  display as text/plain, text/html)
- popup notifications dialog should notify about multiple events
  in a single window (to avoid window pileup when you're gone)
- notification of the ending of a recurring event
- tagging of messages (different from multiple select)

GUI Build:
- make "unlock ui" concept 

Other:
- Outlook Integration (sync w/Outlook via COM, display embedded
  tool via Outlook Folder Home Page and Java Applet)
  (use tool to generate Outlook/COM bindings for Java)
- IE toolbar to display and create wm entries related to webpages
- NNTP sync/browse
  - automatically flag replies to my own posts as high priority
    and optionally deliver them to my inbox.
- group messages into vfolders based on the address book entries
  (i.e. Neotonic, Friends, Other)
- support easily linking data to external webpages. For example,
  if I'm reading an email and want to make it part of my Wiki,
  it should be really easy for me to link the email to the wiki.
- user extensable fields (even on read-only items, such as email
  messages). This requires distinguishing between field types,
  i.e. Mail/* == read/only. A use case would be putting a "status"
  or "note" on email messages so I can can scribble.
- automatic exception/bug reporting (ala Mozilla)
- initial user setup should include a "locale" choice, which
  would setup, among other things, the date format for the user
  which all components will use. (YYYYMMDD or DDMMYYY)
- look at MSProject for date configuration and entry

alanb vm config:
- toggle forward as attachment vs forward inline
- choose different .sigs from compose (pulldown)
- choose different From: identities from compose (pulldown)
- auto choose identity based on identity of reply/folder/etc.
- report spam to VIPUL (spam button)
- headers to view regex
- edit any header from compose
- rfc822 mime digest
- default "save to" patterns
- virtual folders "V", then "C", then (header) then match
